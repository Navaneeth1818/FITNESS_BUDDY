Fitness Buddy is a virtual health and fitness assistant built using IBM watsonx.ai and Agentic AI. It provides personalized workout recommendations, healthy meal ideas, motivational tips, and habit-building support through a conversational interface. Designed entirely on the IBM Cloud Lite plan, the project uses the Granite-3-3-8b-instruct model with a custom knowledge base for reasoning. This project demonstrates how lightweight AI solutions can be developed using prompt engineering without the need for traditional machine learning pipelines or external integrations.
